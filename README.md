  Banks often struggle to understand which customer demographics hold the largest balances, how customer base is distributed across regions, and how new customers contribute over time. Without visual insights, targeting strategies and resource allocation remain guesswork.

  To provide a clear, interactive report that:
  * Segments customers by age, gender, region, and job classification
  * Tracks customer acquisition over quarters
  * Analyzes balance contributions by demographic groups
  * Helps stakeholders design targeted financial products and campaigns
